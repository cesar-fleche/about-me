    <p>In the next 3 to 5 years I see myself pursuing my studies and taking the cyber security course, even though I'm not certain of this choice yet. After that, I see myself continuing to work in this field, on maybe an other one, I am not sure yet!  
        If I finish my studies in this BUT I am thinking of applying to an engineering school.</p>
    <p>I never really had the chance to know what I wanted to do later, which is why I did research and found this Networks and Telecommunications training that I found very interesting. If I don't end up liking this field, I would consider reorienting myself by doing research, going to see guidance counselors, etc… </p>
