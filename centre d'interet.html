        <p> <strong>bodybuilding</strong> is the sport that I practice the most, despite the fact that the nearest gym to me is about a 30 minute walk away.</p><p>Last year when I still lived in Paris, there was a gym right next to my house which was much easier, and I was able to practice often an opposed to here in Blois.</p>
        <p>The exercises that I enjoy the most are the bench press and the dumbbell bench press. which are two exercises that work the pectoral muscles.</p>

        <p class="ma-classe">The two exercises above are very good exercises for working the pectorals but also the triceps and shoulders, which are the muscles that I enjoy training the most.</p>
