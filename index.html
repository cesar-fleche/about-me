    <p>My name is <strong>César Flèche</strong> I recently turned 18 years old and was born on the 17th of September 2005 in Neuilly-sur-Seine. I have lived my entire life in Paris until I moved this year to pursue my studies in Blois. </p>
    <p>I went to two different high schools, the first was Edgard Quinet in the 9th “arrondissement”, I studied there for a year but I then decided to change schools to integrate the sti2d course In chaptal high school. I spent my 11th and 12th grade in this school and obtained a technological baccalaureate, following the ITEC specialty. I now live in Blois as an IUT Networks and Telecommunications student.

    </p>
    <p>In my free time, what I like to do most is to see my friends and go to the gym.I also love foctball, I used to play this sport when I was younger. Even though I stopped, I still practice with my friends occasionally. The sport I currently practice is bodybuilding, it's a sport that I particularly enjoy doing.
    </p>
    <p>I'm a pretty stubborn person, when I have something in mind I am determined to get it, and I also think that I'm a pretty generous person.</p>
    <p>I worked in my final year on a professional project which was to create an underwater drone that could be controlled thanks to a remote. I worked on the ITEC part, which is the mechanical side of the project. We built et with a group of 5 people, including the people on the SIN part of the project. My grand oral exam was even based on these underwater drones, so I had to do a lot of research which allowed me to learn a lot about computers and technology in general.</p>
